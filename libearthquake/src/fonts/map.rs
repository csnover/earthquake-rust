/// CommentStart = ";" | "--"
/// MapModifier  = i"map none" | i"map all"
///
/// FontName     = '"' (NonQuote)* '"' | (NonWS)*
/// SizeMap      = Number "=>" Number
///
/// Comment      = CommentStart (NonCR)* EndOfLine
/// FontMap      = Platform ":" FontName "=>" Platform ":" FontName MapModifier? (SizeMap)* EndOfLine
